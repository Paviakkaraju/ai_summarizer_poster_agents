    "date": null,
    "summary": "Stanford researchers developed SourceCheckup, a tool to audit the factual accuracy of medical information provided by Large Language Models (LLMs).  The study found that 50-90% of LLM-generated answers lacked full support from cited sources, even with models like GPT-4.  This highlights the risk of LLMs \"hallucinating\" or fabricating information, posing a significant concern for healthcare applications. SourceCheckup offers a scalable way to evaluate and improve the reliability of source citations in LLM outputs, crucial for building trust and ensuring patient safety.  The research emphasizes the need for further development before LLMs can be reliably used in clinical decision-making. \ud83c\udfe5"

    "summary": "This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Google Gemini 2.0 with a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using FastMCP.  It leverages FastMCP to define and host tools like fetching weather forecasts and alerts, then connects them to Gemini via an MCP client.  Using function-calling, Gemini receives a natural language prompt, generates a function call based on provided JSON schemas, and executes it via the MCP client, returning structured data.  The tutorial provides a Colab-ready example with code snippets showcasing secure API key handling, dependency installation, and asynchronous execution within the notebook environment. This setup allows developers to easily test and develop MCP integrations locally within Colab."

                 [
                     {
                         "title": "Title of the article",
                         "url": "URL of the article",

                         "summary": "Summary of the article"
                     },
                     ...
                 ]
                 Your task is to: 
                    1. Collect all the summaries from summaries.json,
                    2. summarize them into a single summary (summary of the summaries)in 2 sentences and
                    3. Create hashtags for the summary of the summaries.                   
                 
                 Then return the following output:
                 "Today's AI/ML News":
                 <summary of the summaries>
                 
                 <Article1 title>
                  <Article1 url>
                  <Article1 summary>

                 <Article2 title>
                  <Article2 url>
                  <Article2 summary>

                 <Article3 title>
                  <Article3 url>
                  <Article3 summary>
                  ....
                 
                 <hashtags of the summary of the summaries>

                     Make sure the overall posting content do not exceed 3000 charcters (including text, emojis, spaces)- 
                      - if the content exceeds 3000 characters, give a short title for each article and do not truncate abruptly
                      - if truncation is the only option make sure to truncate title, url and summary as whole of a particular article(s).
